Another particularly striking metacognitive illusion Conan Doyle could have been guilty of is the phenomenon of change blindness blindness. But before we can explain this illusion, first we must describe the phenomenon on which it is based.

Change blindness refers to the phenomenon in which viewers fail to detect (sometimes surprisingly dramatic) changes to a visual scene. One way of demonstrating this effect is through a procedure called a "flicker paradigm" in which two very similar scenes alternate, with a few discrepancies between them. Detecting changes in a flicker paradigm is such a surprisingly difficult task that when a team of psychologists led by Ronald Rensink first tried to publish research on the topic in the mid-90s, their results were initially rejected by peer reviewers as impossible. In other words, the fact people could be change blind was so counterintuitive that even visual scientists were inclined to doubt the reality of the phenomenon.

Today, change blindness is an established part of cognitive psychology. Scientists have even introduced the term change blindness blindness to refer to the fact that people tend to be ignorant of their change blindness. But magicians like Marriott, Tibbles, and Wynter were exploiting such metacognitive illusions in their tricks long before psychologists became formally aware of such phenomena.

Audiences consistently overestimate their ability to detect the hidden methods behind magic illusions

There is now increased interest in using magic tricks in psychological experiments to illustrate these kinds of phenomena. A recent study by Jeniffer Ortega at the National University of Colombia in Bogota and colleagues specifically explored the role of metacognition in magic. Using a series of simple tricks with coins and playing cards, they showed that audiences consistently overestimate their ability to detect the hidden methods behind magic illusions.

People sometimes interpret these kinds of results as demonstrating that your perception is "broken" or your memory is "flawed". But they are really the result of an otherwise well-adapted cognitive system that is mostly effective in working with complex and confusing information every day.

It’s possible to appreciate the intricacies of human memory and perception, while considering the systems' limits and eccentricities, just as you can cherish Conan Doyle for his writing, even if you are not entirely comfortable with his more esoteric views. Reality is often stranger than we imagine.
